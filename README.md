# Gamer bio

This is a gamer bio website created by me when inspired by a website I saw called devbio


# Setup

Clone the repo using `git clone https://github.com/HarryPotter12352/gamer-bio.git`.
In the base directory make a file called `config.json` and enter content of the following format

```json
{"mongo_url": "mongo db url here", "port": 5500}
```
Then run `node index` to start the project and enjoy!


- Note => You must have `node.js`, `express.js`, `mongoose`, and `body-parser` installed
